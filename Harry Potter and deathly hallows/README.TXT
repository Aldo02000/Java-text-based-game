Project: Harry Potter and deathly hallows
Author: Aldo Bega

This project is one of my first projects using a proper programming language.
   
In the game there are 5 rooms and in each room different items can be found. 

For Harry to defeat Lord Voldemort and his army, he has to first become the Master Of Death.
When you become the Master of Death, you are immortal.

But what do you need to become the Master Of Death? 
You need to possess the Deathly Hallows in this order:
1. Elder Wand
2. Stone of Resurrection
3. The Invisibility Cloak

After possesing the Deathly Hallows in order,
Harry needs to go to the Battle Ground and he has to fight Las ord Voldemort, 
but he has to choose the right spell: Expeliarmus

The commands are as follows:
back: sends you back to the previous room
show items: shows the items you have picked up
Quit: Quit the game
North, South, West, East: the directions of the other rooms.
